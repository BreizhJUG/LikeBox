## Housing

### Bill-of-Material

The housing is composed of Plexiglass sheets of 250 x 200 x 8 mm 
They are available at these dimensions and with polished borders on http://www.plastiquesurmesure.com/ [Moulded PMMA sheet, tranparent, shiny, 8mm](http://www.plastiquesurmesure.com/materiaux-plastiques-1/plaque/plaque-pmma-coule-incolore-transparent-brillant-8-mm.html)

~ 40€ for two sheets. 

### Preperation
The cutting plans can be glued on the sheets. The protecting film is kept on the sheets until final assembly.

The cable pass-through holes are made with a wood bit on a colum mounted drill. Slow speed should be used. It is strongly advised to use one or two waste pieced to avoid that the plexiglass splits when the bit exits.

The assembly holes are drilled with a 2 mm metal bit and threaded with a 2.8mm threading tap.

## Raspberry Pi

A first generation Raspberry Pi is sufficient for a basic LikeBox. To use the HDMI output, a second generation Raspbery Pi is recommended as it is more poweful.

~ 50€

## RTC (Real Time Clock) module

module "Tiny RTC" I2C based on a DS1307. Be careful: this module uses a small lithium button battery. So order the module with its battery.

## cabling

We worked a while with breadboard connectors but to avoid connection errors like swithing the buttons (sic) using a ribbon cable. It's cheat and neater.

RS232 debugging connector

## Wifi

The LikeBoxes can work autonomously if a Wifi network is available.
After some bad surprises, we recommend a wifi dongle that is supported out-of-the-box by the kernel with a common chipset as for exemple : http://www.materiel.net/reseau/tp-link-cle-usb-wifi-tl-wn823n-94768.html

## Power supply

- USB power supply (with transformator) or charger. The wires are pushed through the main tube of the tripod.Be careful to choose the USB charger with a looooong wire.
- Battery based power supply
