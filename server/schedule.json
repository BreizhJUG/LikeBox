    "description": "&nbsp;DockerHub contains over 14000 images today and aims to build an ecosystem by promoting reuse. However, a user of a container image has no recourse but to trust the developer's name and description of the image for what the image actually contains. Verification prior to downloading the image isn't possible. We observed that a majority of images in DockerHub are poorly tagged with little information on what software the image contains, not to mention missing OS and software version details. This makes it extremely difficult to reuse existing images, as docker's search API fails to return results even when searching for sets of two or three software (although images exist with these sets of software). Further, a malicious developer can easily slip in malware into an image, which when run by an unsuspecting user could infect large portions of a cloud data center. We present a tool to automatically scan container images and identify software installed in them along with version information (by just looking at files in each layer and the dockerfile, without running the container). We have developed a search API that helps the user search for particular software+versions, allowing for simple operations on versions (e.g, version number =, &lt;, &gt;, major version). We also scan images for known malware, prior to a user downloading the image from the repository. This tool\/service can be part of DockerHub or a stand-alone service with any private image repository. We also present other possible use cases for offline inspection of container images.&nbsp;<br \/>",

    "description": "In this talk we will present how at Bell-Labs (Alcatel-Lucent R&amp;D division) we benefit from using Docker in combination with the SDN solution from Nuage Networks for development and deployment of a next-gen chat-based communication platform. This communication platform does intensive data analytics, runs a number of multi-media services and can control remote appliances (e.g. thermostats, robots, cameras, etc). We will illustrate the stringent telco requirements to successfully operate such a communication platform, including some non-functional needs like high-availability, reliability, elasticity, QoS and lifecycle management. Furthermore, we will explain why we selected docker as a hosting platform and how we have utilized it. We will also share some of the deployment scenarios we are facing and how these are addressed by combining Docker and Nuage VSP. Lastly, we will share the lessons we have learned during this development process, and propose some improvements\/extensions for Docker to evolve into an application stack that is able to meet the stringent needs of telco applications.&nbsp;",

Are infrastructure resources being allocated correctly based on business need? These are exactly the kind of questions that organizations must be able to answer but, surprisingly, they struggle with these questions. Called The Salamander, the tool has provided the bank an unparalleled ability to optimise and simplify business IT processes, which ultimately saves costs and leads to an improved customer experience. The Salamander team designed a solution running on a cloud computing architecture with several NoSQL solutions as Neo4J, MongoDB, REDIS,.... With these repositories they generate data visualisations that clearly demonstrate the relationship between among operations. The front-end and back-end of the application communicate via RESTFUL APIs and NodeJS-based servers provide elasticity when accessing the stored data. The new challenges are related with the need of load and use specific result sets stored and useful to diagnosis but not for immediate reading. At this point appears Docker appears as a solution to offer fast and easy custom database service.&nbsp;<\/p>",

We bridge this inadequacy by introducing Docker and IoT to each other.&nbsp;",

The slower it is to access an image, the more time is wasted pulling new and updated images when spinning up dev environments, running continuous integration workflows, and deploying services in production. Docker Registry enables organizations to deploy a repository for hosting images, giving the organization greater control, security, and manageability over their container images.  We will show how using NetApp technology enables the deployment of a distributed registry which quickly and easily provides users access to their images, regardless of location, while also providing significant storage efficiency savings.<br \/><br \/><\/em><strong>3.&nbsp;Monitoring and managing dynamic Docker environments, Presented by Ruxit<br \/><\/strong><em>This talk provides detailed insights into how to manage large-scale production Docker environments.

It targets data scientists who need to run their data analysis applications without having to worry about systems details. Zoe can execute long running Spark jobs, but also Scala or iPython interactive notebooks and streaming applications, covering the full Spark development cycle. When a computation is finished, resources are automatically freed and available for other uses, since all processes are run in Docker containers.&nbsp;\r\n<p>In this talk we are going to present why Zoe, the Container Analytics as a Service, was born, its architecture and the problems it tries to solve. Zoe would not be there without Swarm and Docker and we will also talk about some of the stumbling blocks we encountered and the solutions we found, in particular in transparently connecting Docker hosts through a physical network. Zoe was born as a research prototype, but is now stable and is currently being used to run real jobs from users in our research institution. Application scheduling on top of Swarm and optimized container placement will also be covered during the presentation.&nbsp;<\/p>",

    "description": "<p>The adoption of Docker brings with it many challenges, not all of themtechnical. There is a clear vision of Docker regularly articulated thatencompasses microservices, decoupled applications, agile and continuous deliveryand integration, and DevOps. But the application of this vision often flounders&nbsp;when confronted by the legacy structures of working and successful businesses.<br \/><br \/>This talk draws on the experienced gained from several attempts to lead changewithin technical organisations. The speaker experienced both failure to effectchange (through productization of a bespoke software stack, and the&nbsp;introduction of Erlang), and success (moving to a Continuous Improvement modelof complex software maintenance). These experiences informed a successful drive&nbsp;to Docker as the build and delivery system of a 700-strong software company,with significant efficiency improvements.<br \/>As with most historical revolutions, the integration of the vision with realityresulted in corners cut and principles compromised in order to effect change.This talk is a discussion of the lessons learned from these experiences in an&nbsp;effort to help the listener clarify and overcome the unique challenges their&nbsp;own organisation brings to making change happen.<\/p>",

Evan will give an overview of the open-source technologies that power PaaSTA, discuss how Yelp has glued these together to give developers control without burdening them with the complexities of the infrastructure, and show the workflow used by developers to update and maintain their services on PaaSTA.&nbsp;<\/p>",

    "description": "Cosmology@Home is a project which uses volunteer computing to analyze cosmological data and answer questions about our universe such as \"how much dark matter is there?\" and \"under what conditions did the Big Bang occur?\" We recently began using Docker by taking each job which we would normally send to our volunteer computers, and packaging it up inside a Docker container. The volunteer computers themselves come from interested users all over the world who download and run the software allowing them to become volunteers (called BOINC). The system is working exceedingly well and using Docker has made it massively easier for us to develop and run it. I will explain some of the technical details of the implementation, which involves a customized boot2docker ISO, as well give a brief summary of the scientific questions we are trying to answer and how these results made possible by Docker are helping analyze data from, e.g. the European Space Agency's Planck satellite.&nbsp;<br \/>",
